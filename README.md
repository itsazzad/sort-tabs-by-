## Installation
1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/itsazzad/sort-tabs-by-.git`
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run build`


## Developing
The following tasks can be used when you want to start developing the extension and want to enable live reload - 

- `npm run chrome-watch`
- `npm run opera-watch`
- `npm run firefox-watch`


## Packaging
Run `npm run dist` to create a zipped, production-ready extension for each browser. You can then upload that to the appstore.
